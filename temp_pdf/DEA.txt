Title 28 Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.) Part 9, an owner or lienor may file a Petition for Remission or Mitigation of Forfeiture

The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), U.S. Department of Justice, gives notice that the property listed below was seized for

The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), U.S. Department of Justice, gives notice that the property listed below was seized for

property or your interest in the property (remission or mitigation), or you may contest the seizure and forfeiture of the property in

Title 28 Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.) Part 9, an owner or lienor may file a Petition for Remission or Mitigation of Forfeiture

Title 28 Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.) Part 9, an owner or lienor may file a Petition for Remission or Mitigation of Forfeiture

                                                            ATTENTION
The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), U.S. Department of Justice, gives notice that the property listed below was seized for

violation of the Controlled Substances Act (Title 21 U.S.C. Sections 801 et seq.). You may petition the DEA for return of the
property or your interest in the property (remission or mitigation), or you may contest the seizure and forfeiture of the property in

Title 28 Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.) Part 9, an owner or lienor may file a Petition for Remission or Mitigation of Forfeiture
(Petition). If you want to contest the forfeiture of the seized property in UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT, you must file a Claim
with the Forfeiture Counsel of the DEA pursuant to Title 18 U.S.C. Section 983(a) and Title 28 C.F.R. Part 8. Upon the filing of a

with DEA, the Petition will be returned to you without a ruling since it does not qualify as a Petition in a judicial forfeiture case under
Title 28 C.F.R. Part 9.4. Submissions by facsimile or other electronic means will not be accepted. Mail will not be accepted or
considered filed on weekends or federal holidays. The names of persons or businesses appearing in this notice are not

The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), U.S. Department of Justice, gives notice that the property listed below was seized for

The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), U.S. Department of Justice, gives notice that the property listed below was seized for

The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), U.S. Department of Justice, gives notice that the property listed below was seized for

The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), U.S. Department of Justice, gives notice that the property listed below was seized for
forfeiture pursuant to Title 21 United States Code (U.S.C.) Section 881, because the property was used or acquired as a result of a
violation of the Controlled Substances Act (Title 21 U.S.C. Sections 801 et seq.). You may petition the DEA for return of the
property or your interest in the property (remission or mitigation), or you may contest the seizure and forfeiture of the property in
United States District Court. Pursuant to Title 19 U.S.C. Section 1618, and regulations governing the petition process set forth in
Title 28 Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.) Part 9, an owner or lienor may file a Petition for Remission or Mitigation of Forfeiture
(Petition). If you want to contest the forfeiture of the seized property in UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT, you must file a Claim
with the Forfeiture Counsel of the DEA pursuant to Title 18 U.S.C. Section 983(a) and Title 28 C.F.R. Part 8. Upon the filing of a
Claim under Title18 U.S.C. Section 983(a), a Claimant may request, pursuant to Section 983(f) and Title 28 C.F.R. Part 8.15,

Remission or Mitigation of Forfeiture” or “Claim”, as appropriate, at the top of the submission. If you filed a Claim and a Petition
with DEA, the Petition will be returned to you without a ruling since it does not qualify as a Petition in a judicial forfeiture case under
Title 28 C.F.R. Part 9.4. Submissions by facsimile or other electronic means will not be accepted. Mail will not be accepted or
considered filed on weekends or federal holidays. The names of persons or businesses appearing in this notice are not

violation of the Controlled Substances Act (Title 21 U.S.C. Sections 801 et seq.). You may petition the DEA for return of the
property or your interest in the property (remission or mitigation), or you may contest the seizure and forfeiture of the property in

Title 28 Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.) Part 9, an owner or lienor may file a Petition for Remission or Mitigation of Forfeiture
(Petition). If you want to contest the forfeiture of the seized property in UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT, you must file a Claim
